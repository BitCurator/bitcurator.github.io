# BitCurator NLP Project

The BitCurator NLP project began on October 1, 2016 and ended on December 31, 2018. BitCurator NLP was supported by a grant from [The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation](https://mellon.org) (grant [31600663](https://mellon.org/grants/grants-database/grants/university-of-north-carolina-at-chapel-hill/31600663/).

BitCurator NLP project personnel developed software for collecting institutions to extract, analyze, and produce reports on features of interest in text extracted from born-digital materials contained in collections.

The software uses existing natural language processing software libraries to identify and report on those items likely to be relevant to ongoing preservation, information organization, and access activities. These may include entities (e.g. persons, places, and organizations), potential relationships among entities (for example, by describing those entities that appear together within documents or set of documents), and topic models to provide insight into how concepts are naturally clustered within the documents.
