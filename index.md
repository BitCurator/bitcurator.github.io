The BitCurator group on GitHub is the primary store for all source code and development documentation developed as part of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation funded BitCurator NLP (2016-2018), BitCurator Access (2014-2016), and BitCurator (2011-2014) projects.

Additional information, user documentation, and community contributions to the BitCurator Environment can be found [on the BitCurator Environment wiki](https://confluence.educopia.org/display/BC). Ongoing support for the BitCurator Environment is provided by members of the [BitCurator Consortium](https://www.bitcuratorconsortium.org/).

## Projects

### BitCurator Environment

The BitCurator Environment is a Ubuntu-based Linux distribution designed to assist collections professionals with media imaging, forensic-style analysis, and reporting tasks when working with digital collections. It can be installed into a clean Ubuntu LTS release, or downloaded as a pre-built VM.

Review the README at [https://github.com/BitCurator/bitcurator-salt](https://github.com/BitCurator/bitcurator-salt) to see how to build BitCurator in a stock Ubuntu 20.04LTS install. Note: The 3.x releases of BitCurator have significant differences from the 2.x releases in terms of interface and tool availability, and are not yet fully documented.


**Some additional PyQT4 tools developed for BitCurator may also be found at:**

[https://github.com/BitCurator/bitcurator-distro-tools](https://github.com/BitCurator/bitcurator-distro-tools)

These tools are maintained for the 2.x and earlier releases, but are not currently being actively developed.

### BitCurator Access Webtools

The BitCurator Access Webtools project is comprised of a single repository. The README provides instructions for both end users and developers to clone and build from source.

### BitCurator Access Redaction Tools

The BitCurator Access Redaction tools project is comprised of two repositories. The READMEs provide instructions for both end users and developers to clone and build from source.

### BitCurator NLP Tools

The BitCurator NLP project includes several repositories. The topic model generation environment (bitcurator-nlp-gentm) enables automatic extraction of text from heterogeneous document collections within disk images to generate user-browsable topic models within a web browser. The disk browsing environment (bitcurator-access-webtools) provides full-text browsing of documents contained within disk images, along with (in progress) analysis of entities identified within those documents. Various command-line tools are provided in another repository (bitcurator-nlp-entspan).
