The BitCurator group on GitHub is the primary store for all source code and development documentation developed as part of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation funded BitCurator NLP (2016-2018), BitCurator Access (2014-2016), and BitCurator (2011-2014) projects.

Additional information, user documentation, and community contributions can be found on the BitCurator wiki at http://wiki.bitcurator.net/. Ongoing support is provided by members of the BitCurator Consortium (https://www.bitcuratorconsortium.org/).

## Projects
***

### BitCurator NLP Tools

The BitCurator NLP project includes several repositories. The topic model generation environment (bitcurator-nlp-gentm) enables automatic extraction of text from heterogeneous document collections within disk images to generate user-browsable topic models within a web browser. The disk browsing environment (bitcurator-access-webtools) provides full-text browsing of documents contained within disk images, along with (in progress) analysis of entities identified within those documents. Various command-line tools are provided in another repository (bitcurator-nlp-entspan).

### BitCurator Environment

The BitCurator Environment (Live CD / Installation CD) is comprised of four repositories (two of which, -adduser and -metadata, are optional). End users should not clone or attempt to build these repositories; the current release can be found at http://wiki.bitcurator.net/. Developers should first consult the README in bitcurator-distro-main for information regarding contributions (test builds, pull requests, and other modifictions).
