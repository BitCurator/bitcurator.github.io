The BitCurator group on GitHub is the primary store for all source code and development documentation developed as part of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation funded BitCurator NLP (2016-2018), BitCurator Access (2014-2016), and BitCurator (2011-2014) projects.

For the most up-to-date documentation on the BitCurator Environment, visit our Releases page (linked in the next section). Community development is managed by members of the [BitCurator Consortium](https://www.bitcuratorconsortium.org/). Community contributions, workflows, and other information can be found [on the Confluence site managed by Educopia](https://confluence.educopia.org/display/BC).

## BitCurator Environment

The BitCurator Environment is a Ubuntu-based Linux distribution designed to assist collections professionals with media imaging, forensic-style analysis, and reporting tasks when working with digital collections. It can be installed into a clean Ubuntu LTS release. Some releases can also be downloaded as a pre-built virtual appliance.


**To download the latest stable release, visit:**

Review the README at [https://github.com/BitCurator/bitcurator-salt](https://github.com/BitCurator/bitcurator-salt) to see how to build BitCurator in a stock Ubuntu 22.04LTS or 20.04LTS install. Note: The 4.x releases of BitCurator differ significantly from the 2.x releases in terms of interface and tool availability.

## Other research projects

### BitCurator NLP Tools

The BitCurator NLP project includes several repositories. The topic model generation environment (bitcurator-nlp-gentm) enables automatic extraction of text from heterogeneous document collections within disk images to generate user-browsable topic models within a web browser. The disk browsing environment (bitcurator-access-webtools) provides full-text browsing of documents contained within disk images, along with (in progress) analysis of entities identified within those documents. Various command-line tools are provided in another repository (bitcurator-nlp-entspan).
