The BitCurator group on GitHub is the primary store for all source code and development documentation developed as part of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation funded BitCurator NLP (2016-2018), BitCurator Access (2014-2016), and BitCurator (2011-2014) projects.

For the most up-to-date documentation on the BitCurator Environment, visit our Releases page (linked in the next section). Community development is managed by members of the [BitCurator Consortium](https://www.bitcuratorconsortium.org/). Community contributions, workflows, and other information can be found [on the Confluence site managed by Educopia](https://confluence.educopia.org/display/BC). 

## BitCurator Environment

The BitCurator Environment is a Ubuntu-based Linux distribution designed to assist collections professionals with media imaging, forensic-style analysis, and reporting tasks when working with digital collections. It can be installed into a clean Ubuntu LTS release. Some releases can also be downloaded as a pre-built virtual appliance.


**To download the latest stable release, visit:**

These repositories will reach end-of-life in April 2023.

**Older, unmaintained PyQT4 tools developed for BitCurator may also be found at:**

These tools were included with the 2.x and earlier releases, but are no longer maintained.

## Older (unmaintained) research projects

### BitCurator Access Webtools

The BitCurator Access Webtools project is comprised of a single repository. The README provides instructions for both end users and developers to clone and build from source.

### BitCurator Access Redaction Tools

The BitCurator Access Redaction tools project is comprised of two repositories. The READMEs provide instructions for both end users and developers to clone and build from source.

### BitCurator NLP Tools

The BitCurator NLP project includes several repositories. The topic model generation environment (bitcurator-nlp-gentm) enables automatic extraction of text from heterogeneous document collections within disk images to generate user-browsable topic models within a web browser. The disk browsing environment (bitcurator-access-webtools) provides full-text browsing of documents contained within disk images, along with (in progress) analysis of entities identified within those documents. Various command-line tools are provided in another repository (bitcurator-nlp-entspan).
