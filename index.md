The BitCurator group on GitHub is the primary store for all source code and development documentation developed as part of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation funded BitCurator NLP (2016-2018), BitCurator Access (2014-2016), and BitCurator (2011-2014) projects.

Additional information, user documentation, and community contributions to the BitCurator Environment can be found [on the BitCurator Environment wiki](https://confluence.educopia.org/display/BC). Ongoing support for the BitCurator Environment is provided by members of the [BitCurator Consortium](https://www.bitcuratorconsortium.org/).

## Projects

### BitCurator Environment

The BitCurator Environment is built in an existing Ubuntu 18.04LTS install using several repositories. Several of these, including bitcurator-adduser and bitcurator-metadata, are optional. See below for more details.

Users looking for the latest release should visit https://github.com/BitCurator/bitcurator-distro/wiki/Releases to download the ISO or preconfigured virtual machine. Alternatively, check out the README at https://github.com/BitCurator/bitcurator-distro-installer or https://github.com/BitCurator/bitcurator-distro-salt to see how to build BitCurator in a stock Ubuntu 18.04LTS install. Developers should first consult the README in bitcurator-distro for information regarding contributions (test builds, pull requests, and other modifictions). Note that some older repositories are deprecated.

### BitCurator NLP Tools

The BitCurator NLP project includes several repositories. The topic model generation environment (bitcurator-nlp-gentm) enables automatic extraction of text from heterogeneous document collections within disk images to generate user-browsable topic models within a web browser. The disk browsing environment (bitcurator-access-webtools) provides full-text browsing of documents contained within disk images, along with (in progress) analysis of entities identified within those documents. Various command-line tools are provided in another repository (bitcurator-nlp-entspan).
