About the Symposium
The symposium consisted of a number of short talks and unconference style break-out sessions on the application of natural language processing (NLP) to support use, access, and analysis of digital primary source materials.

A rapidly growing body of materials with significant cultural value are “born digital.” Information professionals must be prepared to extract digital materials from their original environments and media in ways that reflect the rich metadata and ensure the integrity of the materials. They must also support new forms of access: allowing users to make sense of materials and understand their context.

There are many types of contextual information that can be vital to making sense and meaningful use of digital objects. These can include objects, agents, occurrences, purposes, times, places, form of expressions, concepts/abstractions and relationships.

There are many existing open-source tools that libraries, archives and museums (LAMs) can use to identify, extract and expose such contextual entities from the wide diversity of born-digital materials that LAMs already hold and continue to receive. NLP tools and methods can help to both (1) facilitate curatorial decision making and description, and (2) generate access points to be presented to end users.
