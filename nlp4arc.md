### About the Symposium

The symposium consisted of a number of short talks and unconference style break-out sessions on the application of natural language processing (NLP) to support use, access, and analysis of digital primary source materials.

A rapidly growing body of materials with significant cultural value are “born digital.” Information professionals must be prepared to extract digital materials from their original environments and media in ways that reflect the rich metadata and ensure the integrity of the materials. They must also support new forms of access: allowing users to make sense of materials and understand their context.

There are many types of contextual information that can be vital to making sense and meaningful use of digital objects. These can include objects, agents, occurrences, purposes, times, places, form of expressions, concepts/abstractions and relationships.

There are many existing open-source tools that libraries, archives and museums (LAMs) can use to identify, extract and expose such contextual entities from the wide diversity of born-digital materials that LAMs already hold and continue to receive. NLP tools and methods can help to both (1) facilitate curatorial decision making and description, and (2) generate access points to be presented to end users.

### Speaker Biographies

**Jaime Arguello, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill**

Dr. Jaime Arguello teaches courses and conducts research in the areas of information retrieval, data mining, and machine learning. His main area of research is aggregated search, where the goal is to develop search systems that integrate results from multiple independent sources. Dr. Arguello develops algorithms and evaluation methodologies for deciding which sources to select and how to display them. His most recent research studies how users interact with aggregated search displays and how differences in display affect users’ expectations and behaviors.

Dr. Arguello’s second main area of research focuses on search assistance, where the goal is to develop interactions to help search engine users working on complex tasks. This research aims to understand when and how people employ search assistance. The ultimate goal is to develop systems that automatically provide assistance at the right times and in the appropriate ways.

Dr. Arguello holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. He publishes regularly at information retrieval venues such as SIGIR, ECIR, CIKM, and IIIX. He was a recipient of the SIGIR 2009 Best Paper Award and the ECIR 2011 Best Student Paper Award, and was awarded the NSF CAREER Award in 2015.
